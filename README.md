# Comparison codes of MC-WNNM

The comparison codes of MC-WNNM with the results. 

## How to run?

Except DnCNN, all codes can be executed in the following steps. 

1. Enter the Matlab. 
2. Type `demo_Compare` in the corresponding code directory. 

Foe example, if you want to run `CBM3D`, then you should first enter into Matlab and type `demo_Compare` in the directory `CBM3D/`. 

As for `DnCNN`, first enter into the Matlab and then type `Demo_test_DnCNN_C` in the directory `DnCNN/`. 

## About datasets

It is the same as the datasets of MC-WNNM. 

## Other notes

1. All denoised images are in the directory `denoised_*/` of corresponding codes.
